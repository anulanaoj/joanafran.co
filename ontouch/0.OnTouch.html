        <p> The process of writing this document was established through its making. Acts that led me nose first, leaving thoughts for the second plane. Plans previously made went away once it was understood what I set myself to do, was a re-embodiment of myself. Now, looking at the work, I see it grew legs to continue and hold my hand through what it gives.
            <br><br>I believe the results of my investigation show themselves as not more than what they are. They are attempts of self-insertion, of recognizing my body as such and as belonging to our shared world. This became apparent after starting the outlining practice. I want to belong to myself almost more than I do to the world, and it ends up meaning the same.
            <br><br>So, I speak of agency. Power over one's body. And a need for interaction. I give you examples of this in outside environments. Landscapes are not just outside.   My body is to be seen as one as well. Bodies, objects, landscapes, all the same. I give you interpretations, varied, with my body. My body that I use at my own right.
            <br><br>Sometimes having strange ways to make it seen to me, but I do it nonetheless, and I do it on cotton, pretending I am flat, transmutable, capable of flatness. I urge, inch myself more towards flatness every day, hoping I can see me as you see me. And proving I leave marks.
            <br><br>I've been told by my father, since a child I learned of the world through its aestheticization. I live an  aestheticized life, we all cope in one way or another. My ways of perceiving are what has brought me here. What makes me ask questions, often left unanswered through the over analysis of my steps, my breaths. My space. And because of this, then the color of cement, how many people are filling a bus, is someone having a hard time breathing today? A sense of awareness I curse often.
            <br><br>So, I must tell you, I feel at times responsible for my weirdly heightened senses, with a will for themselves. And things stop making sense, they do at a certain point, and then once accepted, the absurdity of all gives more peace of mind than when it was supposed to be concrete and clear. I believe clearness lies sometimes, as water does when it is blue.
            <br><br>Motivations began with <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i> and me wanting to speak of this, but I believe the Absurd to be something known. I'm happy in this moment to not chew on it. You see, it brings me so much peace as sitting in a, warmed by the sun, stone next to the ocean and closing my eyes. And feel my borders dissipate with those of the land. There I could die. I believe it better than death. These super fuelling breaks I manage to have. Breaks that often come when I am laying on the canvas before defining myself. A little as the calm before the storm.
            <br><br><br></p>

            <br><br>I am now at the airport. Waiting for my turn to be some sardine. I see those in that condition, leaving their plane. Lines, many heads becoming one, different colours, become undistinguishable, as they are many. Something about this document makes me want to take a step towards people and become aligned as well. I must let myself hug and be hugged so I can hug myself.
            <br><br>Seems fair. I hope you understand what I urge you to do. The document is almost as a plea for contact, for touch. And this that I tell you comes when seeing the contradictions I practice so well. I told you of interconnectedness and interaction. But I focus on my experience as a closed space. My movements stays still here.
            <br><br>And it is as a personal struggle heightened by these results I show you that come to tell me it is time I consider people as an integrant part of my work and myself, even if not depicted. My peers, friends, family, and people that pass by all that teach me to interact if I let them. 
            <br><br>In the same way I am a stone, I am you.
